My First try on building a telescope and also develop some kind of software for it. Will take some time
I need to learn C++, I need to transform all the signals to some readable output and I need to build the whole telescope

The building of the telescope, including plans and calculations can be found in the (what a surprise) building folder

Other stuff will follow.

Is C++ the right language to use it for this project? Idk, but it will be pain
